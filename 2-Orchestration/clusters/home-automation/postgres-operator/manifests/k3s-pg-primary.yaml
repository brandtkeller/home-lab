  # secretTemplate is optional. If set, these annotations and labels will be
  # copied to the Secret named example-com-tls. These labels and annotations will
  # be re-reconciled if the Certificate's secretTemplate changes. secretTemplate
  # is also enforced, so relevant label and annotation changes on the Secret by a
  # third party will be overwriten by cert-manager to match the secretTemplate.
