# Home Infrastructure
A catalog of the current and planned state for my Home Lab.

I wanted to document and catalog the updates to my home lab for multiple reasons:
- Assist in capturing plans for modifications to the hardware and identify dependencies. 
- Provide a space for documenting what is deployed and how.
- Ensure all configurations are either declarative or idempotent - such that this can evolve over time.

## Hardware 
The hardware I currently have:
- Dell R710
  - 120gb Memory
  - 2x 8 core 3GHz Processors
  - 2x 1tb SSD (raid1)
  - 4x 500gb SSD (raid10)
- 2x RPI 4 4GB
- 1x ubuntu laptop
  - 16gb memory
  - i5 quad core processor
